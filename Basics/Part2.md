# Phaser 3 Series: Dev 102 (part 2)

Game development, with or without Phaser, shares much in common with general
software development. As such many of the lessons / tools you've practiced in
one field can be used to improve the quality of your work in the other. This
article summarizes broadly applicable guidelines that I've collected over the
years working in complex code bases and have found helpful.

Hopefully you'll find them a good basis on which to build extensible, clear,
and bug free games.

## Principle: Use Supportive Tools

A good carpenter can make do with a bad toolset but

- eslint
- types
- tests

## Principle: Rule of Three

## Principle: Do One Thing Well

## Principle: Loose coupling

## Principle: Composition over Inheritance

## Where to find help

I, and many others, hang out on the [Phaser discord][discord] and are happy to
answer questions there. There is also a [slack channel][slack], and a
[forum][forum]. You can (and should!) also subscribe to [the newsletter][news]
which is often full of useful reading about how Phaser's internals work and
pointers to neat tutorials. Back issues cane be found [here][news-backissues].
