## Where to find help

I, and many others, hang out on the [Phaser discord][discord] and are happy to
answer questions there. There is also a [slack channel][slack], and a
[forum][forum]. You can (and should!) also subscribe to [the newsletter][news]
which is often full of useful reading about how Phaser's internals work and
pointers to neat tutorials. Back issues cane be found [here][news-backissues].
