# Phaser 3 Series: Dev 102 (part 2)

So. Your game is getting off the ground and you've noticed a few things as you
rack up the experience:

1. Game dev, and Phaser, is pretty neat and the community is super helpful;
2. There seem to be a class of mistakes that you _just keep making_ even
   though you know better;
3. Adding all those `<script>` tags to your page is starting to be a real
   annoyance and getting them in the right order is hard (or maybe impossible);
4. Javascript would be way cooler if you could use the modern extensions.

To start, thank you; we try to be helpful and like having you here. Hopefully
you'll stick around and pay that forward some day as others are learning! :D

What about those other patterns? Well, curiously enough, they're all part of
a class of problems that plague everybody. That means two things 1) you
shouldn't feel bad about it and 2) there has bee a _lot_ of work to make life
better.

> Okay, so it's not curious at all. I started out with a collection of
  solutions I wanted to dicuss in part 2 and went through common issues that
  made sense to address which would lead into those answers, :heart:.

## Principle: Use Supportive Tools

In this article we'll talk about how the larger Javascript ecosystem has been
addressing these problems, introduce a host of new tools, and then touch on
some general programming principles that are good to know just for bonus points.

For the time being I'm not going to get into how to set up these tools as each
one is deserving of its own discussion. I will link to template projects that
use some subset of them and other relevant guides. In the beginning you don't
need to understand _how_ the tool is configured for it to be useful so bite
off a little piece at a time and slowly build up your gamedev+Javascript
muscles. When the time comes that you need to customize your setup you'll be
ready and we'll still be here to answer questions ðŸ’ª.

> I'll throw the word `toolchain` around. You may not have heard it before but
  it just means "all the tools you use to build your project." Each project
  has its own toolchain that is usually driven by the personal preferences of
  the original developer.

### Code Linters

### Bundlers / Task Runners

### Dependency Management

### Code Translation (+ Polyfills!)

### Type Checking

### Editors (and Debuggers)

# Part 2: The Bonus Section

## Principle: Rule of Three

## Principle: Do One Thing Well
