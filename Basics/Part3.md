# Phaser 3 Series: Let's Talk About Scenes

Let's talk about [`Scene`][sceneref]. If you're coming from Phaser 2 it's easy
to mistake a this for the older `State` object. If you're just thinking about
the definition of the word it's easy to view them as a linear sequence of
things that flow into each other but are generally independent. Both of these
comparisons are partially correct but they're also a very limited view and can
lead to missing a powerful tool in the battle against complicated code.

This guide is a crash course into what they are, how they work, how to use
them, and where to learn more. I assume a moderate degree of comfort with
both Javascript and Phaser itself. If you haven't worked through a basic
"build your first game" tutorial I would suggest reading [this][guide1] or
[this][guide2] before diving in here.

## What is a `Scene`

A `Scene` in your game is a collection of [`GameObject`][gameobject]s and
related logic which should be kept together. The objects will be drawn when the
scene is rendered and its `update` method will get called on every tick of your
game loop.

And that's it.

[gameobject]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject.html

Where they get special is that Phaser 3 doesn't place any constraints on how
many need to be running. This means you can have 0, 1, or as many as you need
going at once. You can communicate between them and each scene has a z-index
so you can make statements like: "My UI Scene will _always_ be rendered above
the play Scene which is _always_ above the background Scene."

## How do they work

A `Scene` is just a class that extends `Phaser.Scene` and implements one or
more _lifecycle method_. An instance of that class is then passed to the Phaser
framework which tracks what scenes are active, maintains the correct layering
when they're drawn, and initates update and render calls for them.

A super basic scene that logs to the console when its lifecycle methods are
called is defined below:

```javascript
class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super({ key: 'SimpleScene' })
    console.log('SimpleScene#constructor')
  }

  init() {
    console.log('SimpleScene#init')
  }

  preload() {
    console.log('SimpleScene#preload')
  }

  create() {
    console.log('SimpleScene#create')
  }

  update() {
    console.log('SimpleScene#update')
  }
}
```

One thing that a `Scene` does not expose is a function automatically called
during the render step. This is an explicit decision by the framework and it
means that we need to rely on the Scene's display list to put things on the
screen. There are signals emitted before and after the render call if you need
to take action there but we won't dig into them in this doc.

### Lifecycle

Now that we've hinted at the scene lifecycle lets talk about it in a bit more
detail. A simplified model is that it moves between four states: _Create_,
_Update Loop_, _Paused_, and _Stopped_. Most transitions are initiated by a
function call and emit a signal that can be listened for should you need to
take action at specific points in the process.

We summarize scene state transitions and fired events in the following state
diagram. Functions which initiate a transition  are in light yellow and
signals emitted are light orange.

<center><img src='assets/part3-lifecycle.png'/></center>

Additionally the _Create_ and _Update Loop_ states emit several signals and
call defined scene lifecycle functions. Emitted signals are light orange and
the functions you can define are light green:

<center><img src='assets/part3-states.png'/></center>

One potentially surprising behavior is that once a scene has been shut down it
is not garbage collected but, rather, can be resumed via `start()`. When this
happens the three creation functions get called once more. This means any state
tracked in the scene class will be retained between a stopped state and the
next create state. As a result special care must be taken to set a known
initial value on everything requiring one.

### Scene Management a.k.a. Making Things Happen

#### Important attributes

Making a `Scene` dance requires knowing where its control points are. This is
pretty well documented in [the API docs][scene-docs] but it's probably still
worth calling out where a few important things live. These attribute paths
begin with a `this` reference on the assumption your code is in a lifecycle
method. If that is not the case it can be subtituted with any variable
referencing a `Phaser.Scene` (or a child of it).

| Attribute          | What is it | Docs |
| ---------          | ---------- | ---- |
| `this.scene`       | A reference to the `ScenePlugin` object. Contains a bunch of useful methods for managing scene state, layering, etc. | [link][sp-doc] |
| `this.load`        | Access to the `LoaderPlugin` which can be used to queue fetching of external assets. Typically used in `preload` but may also be used outside of it (with additional work). | [link][lp-doc] |
| `this.add`         | Using `GameObjectFactory` it's trivial to create one of the basic Phaser objects, associate it with this scene, and add it to the display list (if appropriate). | [link][gof-doc] |
| `this.physics.add` | Similar to `.add`, `.physics.add` is used to construct (Arcade) physics enabled variants of a game object and associate it with this scene. Matter and Impact physics systems have similar factories as well. | [link][apf-doc] |
| `this.anims`       | The globally shared animation manager; used to create or retrieve animations that can be applied to a sprite. | [link][am-doc] |
| `this.events`      | This is the `EventEmitter` associated with this scene, use it to listen for or publish events. | [link][ee-doc] |
| `this.sys`         | A catch-all location for plugins and other scene-related controls. | [link][sys-doc] |

#### Loading and Displaying objects

Let's start with the easy stuff.

In order to use external assets they need to be loaded first, this is generally
accomplished by using `this.load` to queue retrieval in the `preload()` method.
If there are pending loads after it has been called the `SceneManager` will not
continue the _Create_ flow until all assets have been loaded.

Once you have assets available you can get them displayed by adding them to the
scene display list. This is handled automatically if using a factory associated
with the scene, e.g., [`scene.add`][scene-add] or
[`scene.physics.add`][scene-physics-add]. If there isn't a factory method for
the object you want to add remember that you can also add
[existing objects][scene-existing-add]. As with other factory methods there are
parallel calls in each of the physics systems.

An example of using the scene's loader and object factory to add a background:


```javascript
class DemoScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super({ key: 'demo' })
  }

  preload() {
    this.load.image('background', 'assets/images/background.png')
  }

  create() {
    this.bgImg = this.add.image(0, 0, 'background').setOrigin(0)
  }
}
```

[scene-add]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scene.html#add
[scene-physics-add]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Physics.Arcade.ArcadePhysics.html#add
[scene-existing-add]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.GameObjectFactory.html#existing
[arcade-existing-add]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Factory.html#existing

#### Adding/Removing Scenes

The easist approach is just to add all your scenes in the initial set that get
passed into the Game constructor:

```javascript
new Phaser.Game({
  ...,
  scenes: [ Scene1, Scene2, Scene3 ],
})
```

By default the first scene in that list will run. You can control this behavior
by passing the `autorun` config attribute to the `Phaser.Scene` constructor.

However, sometimes that doesn't work and you need to add a scene at a later
point. If that's the case you can call [ScenePlugin#add][sp-add] which make
the new scene available to use in your game.

If you're done with a scene and need to clean it up for memory conservation
(or any other reason) you can destroy it with [ScenePlugin#remove][sp-remove].

[sp-add]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#add
[sp-remove]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#remove

#### Switching States

Now that you have scenes available to work with the main question is how to
control them.

> *Note*: In all cases following the word "current" references the scene that is
> the parent of the `ScenePlugin` used to change scene state. Additionally most
> methods used to impact scene state can take a key for the scene to act on or
> no argument which causes the action to be taken on the "current" scene.

_-> Create_:

The key methods here are `ScenePlugin` methods [start][sp-start] and
[launch][sp-launch]. Both of these will trigger a scene to move into the
_Create_ state. `start` additionally moves the current scene into _Stopped_
whereas `launch` does not impact the currently running scene.

When calling either of these methods data may be passed in which will be made
available to your scene's `init` and `create` functions. An example of this in
use follows:

```javascript
class GamePlay extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor(ctorData) {
    super({ key: 'GamePlay' })
  }

  init(startData) {
    if (startData.newGame) {
      // set up new game data structures
    } else {
      // load save
    }

    // kick off the UI overlay
    this.scene.launch('GameUI')
  }

  create(startData) {
    this.loadPlayer(startData.player)
  }
}

// In Menu scene

create() {
  startGameButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    this.scene.start('GamePlay', {
      newGame: this.newGame.value(),
      saveSlot: this.saveSlot.value(),
      player: this.player.value(),
    })
  })
}

```

[sp-start]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#start
[sp-launch]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#launch

_Create -> Update Loop_:

Once a scene's `init`, `preload`, and `create` functions complete successfully
Phaser automatically transitions the scene into the _Update Loop_ state. No
developer action is needed here.

_Update Loop -> Pause -> Update Loop_:

While an active scene is in the _Update Loop_ state Phaser will call its
update method and then draw the contents of its display list. It also updates
all objects being tracked by the physics simulation, processes event listener
callbacks, and the like.

A scene may be moved from the update loop into a _Paused_ state by calling
ScenePlugin [pause][sp-pause] and can be moved back via [resume][sp-resume].
While paused the scene will continue to be rendered but no updates to the
contents will happen.

[sp-pause]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#pause
[sp-resume]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#resume

_Update Loop / Pause -> Stopped_:

Finally when it's time to shut a scene down this can be accomplished through
[ScenePlugin#stop][sp-stop]. The scene is removed from active scene list, is
no longer rendered or updated, but is not destroyed and may be activated as
described above in _-> Create_.

[sp-stop]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#stop

### Layering

When **Scene A** is layered above **Scene B** anything drawn to A will be
displayed above of the contents of B. Layering can be controled by calling
well-named methods: [bringToTop][btt], [sendToBack][stb], [moveUp][mu],
[moveDown][md], [moveAbove][ma], and [moveBelow][mb].

[btt]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#bringToTop
[stb]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#sendToBack
[mu]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#moveUp
[md]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#moveDown
[ma]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#moveAbove
[mb]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#moveBelow

### Inter-Scene communications

We now know what a scene is, how to control what state it's in, and can manage
the order in which scenes are drawn. Now to really unlock the power in making
use of multiple scenes let's talk about how to make them work together.

There are _many_ ways to tackle this but I'm going to summarize the three that
I'm guessing will be the most common.

#### The Data Registry

The `registry` attribute in your scene offers access to a globally shared
[DataManager][dm]. One of its key features is that an event is emitted when
the data it stores is changed. Additionally, since it's shared, it's trivially
easy to build an ersatz scene-to-scene communication system. In practice this
would look something like:

```javascript
// In SceneA

create() {
  // ...
  pauseButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    pauseButton.toggle()
    this.registry.set('pause:toggle', buttonObject.value())
  })
  settingsButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    settingsButton.toggle()
    this.registry.set('settings:toggle', settingsButton.value())
  })
}

// In SceneB

init() {
  ...
  // define a mapping between data registry keys and behaviors we want to take
  this.handlers = {
    'toggle:pause': this.pause,
    'toggle:settings': this.settings,
  }

  // subscribe for changes to the global data registry
  this.registry.events.on('changedata', this.registryUpdate, this)
}

// process incoming data changes
registryUpdate(parent, key, data) {
  // check if a handler exists for this key
  if (this.handlers[key]) {
    // if so, call the associated handler with the incoming data
    handlers[key](data)
  }
}

pause(newValue) {
  // handle pause/unpause event
}

settings(newValue) {
  // handle settings open/save/close event
}
```

This approach is certainly not bad and it allows for connecting multiple scenes
with minimal hassle. My primary complaints are:

- it relies on a global state. The problem here is twofold: that state is
  mutable by any reader and mutation on any key results in your handler needing
  to run and check if you got an event you care about
- if you decide that you want to use a type system like [Flow][flow] or
  [TypeScript][ts] then there is no good way to maintain safety through the
  full pipeline
- the namespace for data keys is shared between everything in your game meaning
  it's possible to accidentally use the same key for two different purposes.

None of those are terrible but in aggregate it makes using the (bare) data
registry my least favorite solution for signaling.

#### Function Calls

Since a scene is just object you can call methods that have been defined on
it. As a result, simply calling functions is a viable way for scenes to
communicate. The only trick is that you need to a reference to your scene
but that's easily acquired with [`ScenePlugin#get`][sp-get].

[sp-get]: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.ScenePlugin.html#get

All together, scene to scene function calls is similar to:

```javascript
// In SceneA

create() {
  // ...
  const sceneB = this.scene.get('SceneB')

  pauseButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    pauseButton.toggle()
    sceneB.pause(pauseButton.value())
  })

  settingsButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    settingsButton.toggle()
    sceneB.settings(settingsButton.value())
  })
}

// In SceneB

pause(newValue) {
  // process pause/unpause behavior
}

settings(newValue) {
  // process settings dialog open/save/close
}
```

Using functions we can directly tie an action to its implementation. It's
easier to trace code and in the event we want to switch to a typesafe
javascript stack we'll need fewer tricks to do it.

A downside here is that we've now tightly coupled our scenes together and
changes in one may require corresponding updates to other, non obvious, places.
Without tooling in place to catch this it's entirely possible that a "simple"
refactor to clean up your UI scene could totally break your game and it
wouldn't be obvious until you tried to test that action.

#### Scene Signals

To round out scene communications let's talk about using the scene itself as an
event emitter. This enables a less tightly coupled integration than using
functions directly and doesn't run afoul of the issues that come from just
shoving everything into a global data store with a flat namespace. Because much
of Phaser runs on signals it should also be pretty similar in feel to the rest
of your codebase.

```javascript
// SceneA

create() {
  // ...
  pasueButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    pauseButton.toggle()
    this.events.emit('pause', pauseButton.value())
  }

  settingsButton.on('pointerdown', function() {
    settingsButton.toggle()
    this.events.emit('settings', settingsButton.value())
  })
}

// SceneB

create() {
  const sceneA = this.scene.get('SceneA')
  sceneA.events.on('pause', this.pause, this)
  sceneA.events.on('settings', this.settings, this)
}

pause(newValue) {
  // process pause/unpause behavior
}

settings(newValue) {
  // process settings dialog open/save/close
}
```

As with all use of signals relying on them for scene coordination can eaisly
create a codebase that obscures the link between two bits of code and special
care should be taken that you don't create an untraceable mess.

#### Summary

In general I start working with scene signals and fall back to functions if I
feel that there should be a more obvious link between my scenes. That said,
none of these options are the right solution for all cases so it's important
to understand how they work to help make the best call for your game.

## Additional Reading

In delving into Phaser3 I've gone through a bunch of code and other guides.
The inspiration for the content here comes largely from how I wish that
information had been presented to me.

To that end it feels important to acknowledge other authors who did a bunch
of heavy lifting:

- [How to Create a Game with Phaser 3][game-how]&mdash; For a basic
  introduction to Phaser and Scenes you should probably start here. The state
  diagram they include is sufficient for what it is but mostly drove me to make
  the one in this doc.
- Phaser.io newsletter [part 1](https://madmimi.com/p/a2dddb) and
  [part 2](https://madmimi.com/p/860f1c)&mdash;Everything I didn't learn from
  staring at code came from these two guides. They go into significantly more
  detail than I do about scene setup, customization, and less often used
  features. My goal was explicitly to provide something more approachable than
  these and more detailed than the intro guides.
- The API Docs (for that unstructured learning experience)
  - [Scene](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scene.html)
  - [Scenes.SceneManager](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.SceneManager.html)
  - [Scenes.Systems](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Scenes.Systems.html)
